This bot is dumb and it sucks!!

Features:
-Some commands
-Will announce topic changes to channel
-Will pin any message that is reacted with :pushpin: (📌) to the channel and announce it.
-inline command handler allows new commands to be created via creating a new .js file in the /commands subdirectory.

Notes on use:
    This bot is set up for a sort of socially-run server in which no one has admin unless they request it. All users with the "bro" role may request admin, but it will announce to the announcements channel to let everyone know that someone is escalating to admin.  Since this server involves a small number of trusted individuals, this isn't a problem for us, but it's definitely not a great way of managing a server with lots of users; you may want to eliminate the admin and bro commands or modify them to meet your needs better.
    
    An optional way to use this on a more traditional server is to make the !bro command into something more like !mod.  The command checks to ensure its user is a member of the RoleBro ID, preventing rank-and-file users from escalating themselves but allowing "bros" to manage roles.  However, there isn't an implemented command to remove bro status, so further modification would be necessary, and all bros are able to !admin, which isn't an optimal way of managing permissions.

To use:
1. initialize your config.json by filling in the various IDs; You can rename config example.json for this purpose and fill in the fields.
    -Prefix is the prefix symbol for your bot commands, by default it will be ! but you can change it here.
    I haven't tested with emoji or other nonstandard characters, but any unicode should work.
    -authtoken is your server's auth token !!do not share this with anyone!!
    -ServerID is the server ID.
    -RoleAdmin is the ID for the administrator role for your server.
    -RoleBro is the "Bro" role. In my server it's what at-large users have been given, but you could perhaps repurpose it to be a mod role.
    -channelAnnouncements is the announcements channel. Any use of the !admin command will ping @everyone via this channel.
    -channelBotTest is the channel used for bot testing. At the moment it's not called by anything and may be left blank; As the name suggests it's used for testing purposes.

2. run bot.js (typically, 'node bot.js' will be enough)

-!help lists commands.
-!help <command> will give (somewhat) detailed info on a command.

*Final note about commands:
As of brobot 1.1, the !prune command and !everyone command are commented out as they are test commands I didn't need in my implementation of this bot. You may uncomment them and use them at your peril; they were not heavily bug tested and may have unhandled conditions leading to crash.

Requires: discord.js, fs (module for node.js)
